current runnable code

instead of running hard coded moves, the player can select attack or heal
interestingly, currently heal will kill you!
theres also a class to play music
it works on my machine because I put in the path to the file
not sure how to get it to work on other machines yet

added more documentation for battle class, ability calculator class,
